# Product_Sales_Dashboard
📊 I built an interactive Power BI dashboard by combining the Orders and Order Details tables to analyze overall sales performance. The dashboard includes a 🥧 pie chart for category-wise distribution, 📌 KPIs to highlight total sales and quantities, 🎛️ filter slicers for dynamic exploration, and insights into the 🏆 top 5 states.
